title: "Jekyll Site Launched!"

After messing around with a Namecheap hosted Wordpress site for a while, I've decided to try switching over to Jekyll on GitHub. Probably against my better judgment I'm attempting to make the whole site myself; we'll see how that goes! Anyway, old posts and portfolio items should get imported soon.
